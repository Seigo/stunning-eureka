# Project setup

I've used [this](https://medium.com/@JedaiSaboteur/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658) article as reference to setup React + Babel + Webpack + HotModuleReplacement

Some package versions might be a bit old (webpack) or deprecated (react-hot-loader), but it should be fine for Dojo (for now). ### Update: I have kind-of updated webpack to version 5, but migrating the webpack config was.. chaotic.. so be aware of that
